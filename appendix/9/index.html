          <p2><b>MANNERIST, MANNERED,
          IN THE MANNER OF</b></p2>

        <br><br>
<p2>Our first visit to ATELIERDACOSTA’s houses
  coincided with us discovering Hermann Czech’s
  “Essays on Architecture and City Planning”. Although
  we have no recollection of ever hearing
  the former refer to the latter, both seemed to share
  relevant points of view. “The closer architecture
  stays to life, the more complex it is; it can only be
  ‘simple’ when it becomes removed from it”1, wrote
  Czech. “Our time is all of history, as it is known
  to us”2, he concluded, quoting Josef Frank. This
  seems to be a particularly accurate way to describe
  the spirit of “Casa Crespo”, the first one we
  had the chance to encounter. From the exterior,
  this house does not stand out from the surrounding
  suburban “villas”, except for the fact that its
  façades show an exceptional care for composition;
  at least for the trained eye of fellow architects.
  On the contrary, once inside, it is impossible to
  remain indifferent to the exquisite anachronism
  of its octagonal central space, or to the baroque
  diagonals unfolding in its rear façade. Surprisingly,
  Borromini has found his way to the periphery
  of a peripheral city, of a peripheral country. Yet,
  as is characteristic of their work, this reference is
  not intended to remain a literal quotation, i.e. to
  appear in the manner of Borromini. Rather, it is
  used as a found and recycled formal device in order
  to organise a complex spatial structure for an
  otherwise ordinary suburban house.</p2>
  <br><br>
  <div style="text-indent: 28px">
    <p2>Of course, there is always the risk that these formal
    games will be read as futile gimmicks, designed
    by an over-mannered architect. Or that
    they will not be “read” at all. What is extraordinary
    about these gestures, however, is that they
    are by no means gratuitous. They contribute to
    framing and establishing a succession of spaces
    defined by their qualities rather than their functions.
    With low and high ceilings, wide or narrow
    rooms, views of the horizon, interior patios
    or simply other interiors: there is always a surprising
    passage to be discovered. The kitchen is
    both in the living room and separate. The living
    room can be in the dining room and vice versa.
    Bedrooms retain their intimacy through secret
    vestibules which open contradictorily onto the
    more “public” areas. The house has an architecture
    that is not only made up of rooms, nor is it
    exactly a plan libre. It is a synthesis of both: a kind
    of raumplan, but not quite. It is a structural grid
    within which disruptions are organised. In any
    case, it is an ingenious multiplication of possibilities
    or what Czech would call the attitude of mannerism:
    “one of intellectuality, of consciousness;
    also, a sense of the irregular and the absurd, that
    breaks away from pre-established precepts”.3</p2>
  </div> <br>
  <div style="text-indent: 28px">
        <p2>
            Unfortunately, when we visited the house, what
            appeared to be the first scene of a production of
            the “Poor Rich Man” was taking place. A team of
            decorators was furnishing the house from one end
            to another in the latest soap-opera neo-bourgeois
            style. Defining precise functions and neutralising
            any sense of potential or possibility. As Loos wrote,
            “the only thing left for [the client] was to learn how
            to walk around in his own dead body”.4</p2></div>

            <p2><b>THE VERNACULAR AND THE ERUDITE
              ARE ONE AND THE SAME.</b></p2><br><br>
          <p2>On the basis of Peschken’s “Temple and Democracy”,
            Philippe Villien has built a theoretical bridge
            between the vernacular architecture of granite
            granaries and the erudite architecture of Doric
            temples. His aim was to show that the leap between
            the two may have been made by transcription,
            rather than by rupture or innovation.5 According
            to this hypothesis, the Greek triglyphs would correspond
            to the traces of the granaries’ ventilation
            panels. Both Corinthian and Ionic capitals would
            be formal heirs to those ecological devices that
            protect crops from climbing insects, such as the
            protrusions that top the columns of Portuguese
            espigueiros. Not to mention, of course, the translation
            between the form of classical pediments and
            the simple need to drain rainwater from the roofs.</p2>
          
          <br><br>
          <div style="text-indent: 28px">
            <p2> This perspective is particularly interesting as it
unveils a potential nexus between utility and effect,
functionalist reason and ornamental fruition.
A similar understanding of this affinity was also
patent, for instance, in Alison & Peter Smithson’s
work illustrated in “Climate Register”.6 A small
book presented their work, with an emphasis on
the impact that climate devices played in both the
technical rationality and the architectural grammar
of their proposals. A look at the façades of ATELIERDACOSTA’s
reveals the same kind of sensibility.
Perhaps the case in which this tension is
most illustrative is the (oversized) concrete cornice
of “Casa Rates”, built on top of an ordinary slate
wall. Cornices are a clear historical example of this
superposition of utility and effect. In this case, a
particularly sophisticated concrete element, which
at first glance could have come from a nearby demolished
monastery (as is the case of an existing
Romanesque church capital), sits on top of an otherwise
rudimentary construction. The fact that
concrete fits into the existing cornerstones emphasises
this ambiguity. The same goes for the geometric
irregularity of its floor plan, which leaves
us wondering what already existed and what has
truly been added. And yet, be it a temple or a modest
farmhouse, the mundane problem of preventing
water from running down a façade is still an
excellent pretext for crowning a building.</p2></div><br>

  <p2>
This desire to manipulate, exaggerate, or simply
compose a façade out of the need for banal and
utilitarian elements (which often conceded an undesirable
role to architecture) is not exclusive to
their “Casa Rates”. Take, for instance, “Lote 7”, where the high relief of a banal ETICS system
draws a frieze around the whole house, emphasised
over the windows in order to hide the house’s
shading system. A frieze which is topped with
an expressive concrete, coping to manage, once
again, rainwater dripping. Or else, the importance
of the blinds now visibly applied over the wooden
façades of “Casa Gemeses”, where the weather
blends with the concrete foundation, in a unified
soft grey interrupted only by the most beautiful
orange frames. Or even still, the projected concrete
porticoes, which act as brise-soleils and structural
support for the awnings that regulate the exposure
of “Casa Artur” to sunlight. Through these operations,
the milieu crystallises into matter and architecture
reveals its ancestral relationship with a
deep understanding of the word ecology.</p2></div>

<p2><b>LEARNING TO THINK FROM THOSE
  WHO CAN MAKE</b></p2><br><br>
  <p2>
    One of the misunderstandings on which architecture
has been lying for centuries, particularly
since the classical Renaissance, has to do with the
promotion of a strict division between intellectual
and manual labour on the building site; a process
of abstraction that only seems to have accelerated
since the advent of capitalism. As it goes,
there are those in charge of design7 and those who
execute what the former have imagined: however
absurd these images may be from the producers’
point of view. Of course, our practical experience
has taught us that the opposite is true and almost
everyone involved in the construction process uses
elementary drawings as a tool for thinking. Unlike
bees or spiders, construction workers plan ahead
in their heads, which, according to Marx’s wellknown
formulation, indicates they are not so far
from being architects themselves. Too often, the
main difference is that the formers’ approaches to
design are much more rational and supported by
material reality than those of the latter.

  <p2> 

  Another dichotomy that restrains the progress of
  architectural thought is the socially constructed
  idea of the existence of a high and erudite culture, to
  which architecture belongs, as opposed to a lower,
  popular culture to which every other minor form
  of construction should be confined. On the contrary,
  the paradoxical position our generation
  finds itself in is that architecture seems to have
  finally reached out to classes that were excluded
  from it not so long ago. Both on the side of
  practitioners and commissioners, architecture no
  longer concerns only the classes with the most
  (economic or cultural) capital, nor the most underprivileged,
  to whom their philanthropic or
  utopian idealism has historically been addressed.
  This, of course, does not mean that everyone in
  these other intermediate classes has made it into
  architecture. In many cases, architecture is still
  perceived as nothing more than a bureaucratic
  procedure to be fulfilled, an inconvenience by
  decree. The ability to bring architecture to every
  corner of a city that seems to have become an infinite
  periphery depends on the ability to build
  intellectual bridges. The opposite is to adopt a
  condescending or patronising attitude, reducing
  clients to a bunch of ignorant people.

    <p2>  As we have previously argued regarding the
work of FALA, we believe that these peripheries
have been revealing the inventive spirit of their
inhabitants for decades, for those willing to pay
attention.8 Benefits come from making architectural
design an intellectual apprenticeship for
both parties. A perfect example of what we are
trying to achieve is “Casa César”. Starting from
a client’s preconception — “to build a stone house
with a pitched roof” — the Atelier was forced to
learn the economic and ecological relevance of
this type of construction, even today, if considered
from the subjective perspective of its local
production. From the exterior, it is almost impossible
to determine the era in which “Casa César”
has been conceived. It’s even doubtful whether or
not an architect was actually involved in its construction.
Each element seems to reveal the sensibility
of neo-popular architecture, such as the
way rainwater is handled through a “beirado à
portuguesa”. Although as soon as we take a closer
look at the floor plans, we once again discover the
same intellectual ambition and confidence in the
spatial complexity of Baroque architecture.

    <p2>  In 1960, even before writing The Architecture of
the City, Aldo Rossi was already concerned with
“the problem of the periphery”9, as he considered
it to be “the future of the city”10. If we take a look
at the Portuguese landscape, it will be easy to see
that he was not wrong about it. And yet, within the
disciplinary field of architecture, especially from
a practical point of view, little has been produced
since in order to understand its structures and
transform them in their most basic implications.
In our opinion, ATELIERDACOSTA has already
made significant contributions. After all, even the
periphery needs its temples. And in this respect,
ATELIERDACOSTA seems to have what it takes.
