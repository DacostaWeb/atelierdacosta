<p2>"Currently, architecture is always discussed
  in terms of articles of faith about the way
  the public and society in general should be.
  Proposed systems always attempt to provide
  a single plan for the whole of society, though
  the proponents of such systems are doubtless
  aware that no such thing is possible. Our generation,
  on the other hand, cannot be content
  with continuing to create one part of a vast
  ring that cannot be completely closed. We reject
  the idea of an image system that cannot
  cover the entire picture. This is true because,
  unable to close our eyes to the complexities
  and contradictions of society, we feel stripped
  and weak in the face of the necessity to gamble
  everything on a single ideal. Finishing
  materials, colour schemes, finish styles, and
  patterns comply with the ownersâ wishes,
  no matter how vulgar. Once again, since
  the building is theirs, we have no say on the
  matter. We do not believe in the myth that
  designing a house changes the personality of
  its owners. The house is the battlefield where
  the client and I encounter each other. It is not
  a skillfully made parade of toy soldiers with a
  flag and a band at their head."<sup>2</sup></p2>
          </div>
          <div style="text-indent: 28px"><p2>
            "Unlike the artists or other prominent cultural
figures who are the clients of architects whose
works are often seen in the architectural journals,
my clients are simply ordinary people.
When they asked me to design their homes,
it was apparent from the start that none of
them wanted me to design a dwelling that
would be a creative architectural âworkâ. So,
the questions that preoccupy an architect, such
as the form of the structure or the concept on
which it is to be designed, never entered into
our conversations. Since only the clientâs concerns
are put up for discussion, the designer is
forced to proceed with the work, giving greater
priority to the concerns of living than to
abstract matters of artistic expression. These
were projects that made me think that there
was no room for introducing any such thing as
theories of architecture. When I met the first
client, he assumed an attitude of complete disinterest
in any âthemeâ that might be the concern
of the designer. I found myself wondering
about the viability of imposing artistic qualities
on an architectural work, and about the
very merits of buildings designed as âworks of
artâ. I found that there was no other way to
proceed than to put a priori themes aside and
to think in terms of the site where the design
would actually be built. To choose such an approach,
l realise, is to bring architecture down
from the lofty realms of theory to the level of
the act of designing. This is how I began to
pursue my work in design, attempting to rethink
the nature of architecture by viewing
it from the dimension of event and accidental
happening."<sup>3</sup></p2>
          </div>
          <div style="text-indent: 28px"><p2>
            "A design must not be based on arbitrary
conditions, such as whether or not the site is
beautiful, or whether it is broad or narrow. In
other words, I mean that the design of a house
should be based on an armature of ideas, independent
of the shape and environment of
the site. Also, a house must not be designed
for the client. The architect must be free from
the client. Whether or not the clients understand,
whether or not the carpenters are excellent,
all the good and bad aspects of house
design should reflect the good and bad aspects
of the architects themselves. And, from
the moment construction is complete and the
house is handed over, the architect has no
right to speak. The family is free to use their
house as it pleases, or even more beautifully
than the architect intended. This alternation
between disappointment and pleasure is only
proof that the autonomy of house design is not
owned by the architect but shifts to the client.
You are free to live in a house as chaotic
as you like, but if the scenes are unsatisfactory
for publication in a magazine, the architect
will rearrange things to suit his liking, choreographing
them such that the residents âmay
not even toss in their sleepâ. So, hypothetically,
if a house is always disorderly, the spaces
being choreographed may be described as
completely fictional. But such fictions must be
presented to society at large. Fictional spaces
have a magnificent power and, unlike public
buildings, it is especially necessary for houses
to achieve sufficient fictional meaning. We
should carry out our creative activities without
worrying about methods of comparison
with the real thing. The calibre of a work of
architecture corresponds to the calibre of the
fictional value structure from which it arises. I
have claimed that a house is a work of art. Art
lies in the ways that the design of a house may
bond with society and, if it does not become
a work of art, it has no reason to exist. Therefore,
strengthening the reciprocal connection
between house and society is not a secondary
task. It is an obvious aspect of house design,
and includes conveying it through mass media.
So, for me, a fictional space is never fictional."<sup>4</sup></p2>

            "The architect is perhaps concerned only with
            the meaning-giving structure of architecture,
            that is, its rhetoric. Robert Venturi writes,
            âI try to talk about architecture rather than
            around itâ. When we say that the architect is
            interested in ârhetoricâ, we must recognise
            that this rhetoric is functionally different
            from the rhetoric of social meaning (ideology)
            that I have called the first language of a lived
            house. Through rhetoric, architecture creates
            new registers to be read. If people find new

            A few weeks ago, over dinner, me and Hugo were
discussing how difficult it is to express our disciplinary
concerns to those who we work for.
Although our practices have different structures
â and perhaps different desires â, we operate in
the same circles, with overlapping anxieties. For
a few hours, in a cathartic exercise, we happily
criticised our context, cultural and economical,
shared stories of common places, and ended up
agreeing on the fact that, more often than not,
we find ourselves being the only ones âwho careâ.
Better still, we often find ourselves impersonating
the madman, shouting alone to an absent
audience. The conversation reminded me of the
context of a generation of Japanese fallen heroes,
that often recur within FALA, with reflective
texts written at times when such authors were
struggling with their careers and facing or theorising
about similar struggles. One could suppose
that, in a very different, but possibly not so different,
context, cycles come to repeat.</p2>

          <div style="text-indent: 28px"><p2>
            Writing a text is like doing a project: you need some
            sort of an idea, or intellectual framework, to do it.
            It canât, or at least shouldnât, be purely compositional.
            A good text needs an angle, a direction, and
            requires that its final form respects and potentiates
            its intention. The structure doesnât always work
            and sometimes it ends up disguised as a motif. In
            this case, to be clear, the hint was to appropriate
            some of the generational texts that the conversation
            reminded me of, and to manipulate them as
            primary matter. To remove from the declarations
            all references to their authors, time, and context
            and, while reorganising the appropriated bits and
            pieces, to claim them as mine, written today, as de
            facto statements. To take the opportunity to project
            my possible personal understanding of ATELIERDACOSTA
            condition through someone elseâs
            gaze of a distant problem. To take a specific house
            in Vila do Conde as a model of a generational disciplinary
            enquiry. A collage, maybe; a fiction of our
            reality and despair, certainly.</p2>
          </div>
          <div style="text-indent: 28px"><p2>
            I had the chance to first get to know Casa Crespo
            at a lecture ATELIERDACOSTA did in Lisbon a
            couple years ago. Amongst other projects, it was
            shown with scarce photographic materials, since
            it was still under construction; most of the available
            images were of a skeleton-like object, full of
            light, still rendering. Amongst the drawings, the
            Baroque plans fascinated me as they referred to an
            active and assumed use of history for contemporary
            production of architecture, something I believe
            the discipline should stand for. Between other
            hints and references, Borrominiâs San Carlo alle
            Quattro Fontaneâs plan was theirs, for a few minutes
            of conversation, and until life do us part, in
            the soon-to-be-built house. On another level, the
            house that was presented didnât try to solve anything,
            to address any social concerns, to be political,
            to inflict anything, but to be a thing per se.
            That house approached architecture as I foolishly
            hope all houses could do. Regardless of its final
            form, it was a disciplinary exercise before being
            anything else. The outside shell, proto-modern
            and suburban â relatable â, defined a buffer to
            the world. Someone walking by would probably
            not notice it, reading it as another amongst many,
            camouflaged; yet, in such a threshold, the evident
            quality of its design was there, for the few who
            would be able to notice it. Inside, with no ornament,
            but through an ornamental understanding,
            it felt complex and neoclassical, even with all the
            walls plastered in white, flat, incomplete. A fortunate
            contradictory object, a la Venturi.</p2>
          </div>
          <div style="text-indent: 28px"><p2>
            Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the house,
            to add the physical in situ experience to the fictional
            one I had assembled from its authorsâ images and
            words. With the owners away, but the Koolhaasian
            maid doing her chores, we had about one hour to
            study the battlefield where Hugo and Diogo admitted
            defeat while talking about how they had
            to abandon the project close to the end, after âthe
            architect was not necessary anymoreâ. The scars of
            the lost battle were all over the place, evident: Life
            with Objects, clichÃ© nouveau riche, interior decorator
            bullshit propaganda at its prime. An absolute
            incapacity to read the spatial qualities by those who
            solicited them. Beyond the visual clutter, chirurgical
            changes that attacked the projectâs intentions at
            their core revealed the stricken misunderstanding
            that the house represented.</p2>

            <p2>Needless to say, when asked to write a text about
              a house, one could, and probably should, describe
              said house. Claim its merits. Have the courage to
              criticise it, negatively if necessary, with wit and intelligence.
              Put it in a certain context, be it political,
              social or economic, and make sense of it. To propose
              a theoretical understanding of it, even. However,
              this text doesnât do any of that. And if anyone tries
              to read it from such a perspective, it will succumb.
              It is, quite literally, a collage of two antagonistic
              blocks: the first stolen and manipulated from fallen
              heroes, the second without structure or obvious
              goal. This text, like the house it supposedly reflects
              upon, is a composition, a difficult double, hiding its
              intentions in plain sight.</p2></div>
              <div style="text-indent: 28px">
            <p2>Within FALA, I like to discuss with Ahmed the fact
              that he still naively believes it is possible to always
              have one foot in both worlds (ours and the clientâs)
              and achieve a satisfactory project for both. After so
              many downfalls in the battlefield, I cynically donât
              believe it anymore, because to a certain degree I
              never did. The Venn diagram doesnât overlap and
              very few exceptions, usually due indifference and /
              or circumstance, help to prove a rule, nothing more.
              Nevertheless, and despite the long distance between
              the words of the designers and interpretations of
              the inhabitants, Casa Crespoâs intellectual charm
              was there, untouched, unattackable: an exterior
              deconstructed shell protecting the gorgeous double-
              height octagonal space from the world. Not in a
              purely rhetorical manner, nor in a phenomenological
              sense, the house was a house. Full of trash, but
              frank. Maybe, as it was always meant to be.</p2>
